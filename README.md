# Super-Mario-Kart-Practice-Hack
A practice romhack for Super Mario Kart (NTSC and PAL)


## How to patch

- Apply the appropriate NTSC or PAL .ips patch to your vanilla Super Mario Kart ROM with the included Lunar IPS program. 
- Enjoy.

## Features

- Support for both NTSC (US) and PAL versions.
- Special cup is unlocked by default in both Mario Kart GP (100cc) and Time Trial modes.
- Onscreen, color coded speedometer: White for when below top speed, Green for at top speed, Orange for above top speed. **NOTE: This feature was made with Time Trial and 100cc in mind (1 Player). While the speedometer can work in other modes/cc's, it may not be accurate.**
- Boost indicator:  The number above the speedometer will change to a 1 if you have a boost value of 128 or above.

## Known Issues

- While more of a side effect than a bug, the in-game text during a race (Like the retry menu) may inherit the color from the speedometer, due to shared palettes.

## Special Thanks

- Zewing for commissioning me.
